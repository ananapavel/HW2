              <h3>Berserk</h3>
              <p>
                Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story
                centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and
                Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the
                Hawk". Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The
                series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct
                magazine Monthly Animal House, which was replaced in 1992 by the
                semimonthly magazine Young Animal, where Berserk has continued
                its publication. Following Miura's death in May 2021, the final
                chapter that he wrote and illustrated was published posthumously
                in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022,
                under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood
                friend Kouji Mori and Miura's group of assistants and
                apprentices from Studio Gaga.

              <h3>Hellsing</h3>
              <p>
                Hellsing is named after and centered around the Royal Order of
                Protestant Knights originally led by Abraham Van Helsing. The
                mission of Hellsing is to search for and destroy the undead and
                other supernatural forces of evil that threaten the queen and
                the country. This organization is currently led by Sir Integra
                Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who inherited the leadership of
                Hellsing as a child after the death of her father. She witnessed
                his death which turned her from a once innocent and shy little
                girl to a tough and deadly force. She is protected by the
                faithful Hellsing family butler Walter C. Dornez, a deadly foe
                in his own right, and Alucard, the original and most powerful
                vampire, who swore loyalty to the Hellsing family after being
                defeated by Van Helsing one hundred years before the story takes
                place. These formidable guardians are joined early on in the
                storyline by former police officer Seras Victoria, whom Alucard
                turned into a vampire.

              <h3>Hunter × Hunter</h3>
              <p>
                The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told
                all his life that both his parents were dead. But when he learns
                from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is
                still alive and has since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon
                leaves his home on Whale Island (くじら島, Kujira Tō) to take
                the Hunter Examination (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) in order to
                become a Hunter like him. During the exam, Gon meets and
                befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last
                remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become a Hunter
                in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing
                eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a band of thieves
                known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician
                who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the financial
                benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another
                twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of
                the world's most notorious assassin family. Among many other
                examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and
                deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After many
                trials together, Gon and his friends end up passing the exam
                except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant due
                to the influence of his brother, Illumi, and runs away to his
                family's estate in shame.

              <h3>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</h3>
              <p>
                The universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reflection of the
                real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and
                beings. In this setting, some people are capable of transforming
                their inner spiritual power into a Stand (スタンド, Sutando);
                another significant form of energy is Hamon (波紋, "Ripple"), a
                martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily
                energy into sunlight via controlled breathing. The narrative of
                JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts with independent
                stories and different characters. Each of the series'
                protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline
                descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left
                shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular
                "JoJo". The first six parts take place within a single
                continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry
                between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter two
                parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar
                family tree is heavily altered.

              <h3>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</h3>
              <p>
                Edward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother
                Trisha and father Van Hohenheim, the latter having left without
                reason. Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their
                alchemy training under Izumi Curtis, the Elrics attempt to bring
                their mother back with alchemy. But the transmutation backfires,
                and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse is completely
                deconstructed. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve
                Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is
                invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist (to research
                a way to restore their bodies) and undergoes a painful medical
                procedure that grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward
                becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal
                Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for
                the mythical Philosopher's Stone to achieve their goals.

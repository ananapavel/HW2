          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
          <p>
            Guts, a man who will one day be known as the Black Swordsman, is a
            young traveling mercenary characterized by the large greatsword he
            carries. He accepts jobs that offer the most money, but he never
            stays with one group for long—until he encounters the Band of the
            Hawk. Ambushed after completing a job, Guts crushes many of its
            members in combat. Griffith, The Band of the Falcon's leader and
            founder, takes an interest in Guts and duels him. While the others
            are no match for Guts, Griffith defeats him in one blow.
            Incapacitated and taken into the Band of the Hawk's camp to recover,
            Guts wakes up two days later. He confronts Griffith, and the two
            duel yet again, only this time with a condition: Guts will join the
            Band of the Falcon if he loses. Due to his fresh injuries, Guts
            loses the fight and is inducted by Griffith. In three years' time,
            Guts has become one of the Band of the Hawk's commanders. On the
            battlefield, his combat prowess is second only to Griffith as he
            takes on large groups of enemies all on his own. With Guts' immense
            strength and Griffith's leadership, the Band of the Hawk dominate
            every battle they partake in. But something menacing lurks in the
            shadows, threatening to change Guts' life forever.

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Kenpuu Denki Berserk adapts the first 12 volumes and a part of the
            13th volume of the manga. While the story remains fairly loyal to
            the source material, heavy modifications were made to exclude some
            of the more graphic depictions of violence, as well as characters
            and other content that could not be covered within the length of the
            anime’s running time. These changes were approved by the series
            creator himself. The series was released on DVD by Media Blasters in
            six volumes from May 28, 2002 to May 27, 2003. The company also
            released a complete collection on November 16, 2004; it was later
            remastered by AnimeWorks and published on March 10, 2009. An art
            book—titled Berserk: Kenpuu Denki - Kanzen Kaiseki-sho—containing
            sketches and behind-the-scenes information on the anime was
            published by Hakusensha on December 9, 1998.

      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p>
        Guts, a man who will one day be known as the Black Swordsman, is a young
        traveling mercenary characterized by the large greatsword he carries. He
        accepts jobs that offer the most money, but he never stays with one
        group for long—until he encounters the Band of the Hawk. Ambushed after
        completing a job, Guts crushes many of its members in combat. Griffith,
        The Band of the Falcon's leader and founder, takes an interest in Guts
        and duels him. While the others are no match for Guts, Griffith defeats
        him in one blow. Incapacitated and taken into the Band of the Hawk's
        camp to recover, Guts wakes up two days later. He confronts Griffith,
        and the two duel yet again, only this time with a condition: Guts will
        join the Band of the Falcon if he loses. Due to his fresh injuries, Guts
        loses the fight and is inducted by Griffith. In three years' time, Guts
        has become one of the Band of the Hawk's commanders. On the battlefield,
        his combat prowess is second only to Griffith as he takes on large
        groups of enemies all on his own. With Guts' immense strength and
        Griffith's leadership, the Band of the Hawk dominate every battle they
        partake in. But something menacing lurks in the shadows, threatening to
        change Guts' life forever.
